Variables such as 

    1. population size 
    
    2. time span 
    
    3. maximum change in velocity of individuals 
    
    4. mutation rate values of above-mentioned variables are changeable using range slider on the web page.
    
It also includes a graph which represents two values for each generation: 

    1. maximum individuals reached the target in single generation till the current generation
    
    2. total individuals reached the target in the current generation
    
Position of the target can also be changed by clicking anywhere on canvas but the position of obstacle is variable so it will also change according to the target's position.
